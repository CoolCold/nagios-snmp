- Net::SNMP and Getopt::Long
- File utils.pm in Nagios plugin directory (default /usr/local/nagios/libexec)

Installation:
-------------

You can simply copy the files to the Nagios Plugin directory if it is in /usr/local/nagios/libexec.

You can also use the "install.sh" script provided in this directory to install the plugins.
Type : "./install.sh" to install all the plugins or "./install.sh <plugin name>" for a specific one.

The script will check for dependencies and ask for Nagios and temp directories.
It will modify the scripts dependding on these answers and install the scripts. 

By default, the scripts will consider : 
- perl is in /usr/bin/perl
- Net::SNMP and Getopt::Long
- Nagios plugins (and file utils.pm) are in /usr/local/nagios/libexec
- Temp files will be written in /tmp
