Installation:
-------------

You can simply copy the .pl files to the Nagios Plugin directory if 
- Nagios plugins and utils.pm file are in /usr/local/nagios/libexec.
- You are sure Net::SNMP is installed. (Getopt::Long is standard).
- perl is in /usr/bin/perl
- Temp files can be written by Nagios in /tmp

You can also use the "install.sh" script provided in this directory to install the plugins.
Type : "./install.sh" to install all the plugins or "./install.sh <plugin name>" for a specific one.

The script will check for dependencies and ask for Nagios and temp directories.
It will modify the scripts dependding on these answers and install the scripts.
